## R CMD check results
# TODO: insert R CMD check results here before submission


## CRAN notes justifications
  
* This library includes a precompiled java binary file. This often will exceed the 5Mb CRAN limits. Unfortunately the 
alternative of building the library from source code causes a `R CMD check` warning due to inclusion of dependency management
configuration `pom.xml` files. 
* R6 is a build time dependency so appears unused when it is in fact not.
* This is a new release.
